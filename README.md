# Dark-Lands
A roguelike where you lead a band of foolhardy explorers on a previously-undiscovered continent

This project is also the codebase for an ongoing tutorial series where I step through the process of making a roguelike using curses.

You can find the tutorial [here](http://df458.github.io/tutorials/roguelike_intro.html).
